# There are multiple methods to compute principle components (PCs) in r. Here I show how you can compute PCs using prcomp.

# load and preprocess the data, the input should be an r dataframe. This mtcars is a built-in dataframe.
mtcar_sel = mtcars[, c(1:7, 10, 11)]

# Only one line command is needed to compute PCs. The only needed input is a dataframe with each column is a feature while each row is a/an sample/individual/observation.
# You can choose to center and scale each feature by specifying center = TRUE, scale = TRUE.
mtcars_pc <- prcomp(mtcar_sel, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)

# The output of prcomp includes:
# center: The mean values of each column of the input matrix. The columns are also named as "variables".
# scale: The standard deviations of each column of the input matrix
# sdev: The standard deviations of the PCs
# rotation: The coefficients of PCs, normally named as "loading". This is actually the coefficient of the linear combination of each column of the imput matrix.
# x: All PCs -- "All" means the maximum number of PCs which is the number of columns of the input matrix.
```

```{r}
# Next, I will show the visualization of PCs. I chose "factoextra" package.
if("factoextra" %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE) {
  install.packages("factoextra")
}
library(factoextra)
```

```{r}
# Histogram shows the percentile of the variations explained by each PC.
# The "dimensions" for the label of x axis is the dimension of PCs. The 1st dimension is the 1st PC, etc.
fviz_eig(mtcars_pc)
# Scatter plot of PC1 and PC2 with text annotation. The warning means that there are annotation cannot be made due to the requirement of "non-overlap" (annotations).
fviz_pca_ind(mtcars_pc, repel = TRUE)     # Avoid text overlapping
```
